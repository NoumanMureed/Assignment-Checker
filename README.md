# Assignment-Checker
I've built an assignment checking platform with professor and student views. Here's what I've implemented recently:

1 Created complete data schema with users, assignments, submissions, and grades.
2 Built professor dashboard with assignment creation and grading features.
3 Added student dashboard for assignment submissions.
4 Implemented file upload with plagiarism detection.
5 Created grading modal with detailed rubric scoring.
